# YouTube ETL Project

## Overview
This project implements an ETL pipeline that extracts data on the top 50 viral YouTube videos in the US, cleans and transforms the data, and outputs a CSV file with the processed results.

## Technologies Used
- Python (for ETL scripting)
- Apache Airflow (for scheduling and orchestration)
- YouTube Data API (for data extraction)
- Pandas (for data transformation and cleaning)
- PostgreSQL (for data storage)


## Project Motivation
This is a personal project developed to apply and test skills acquired in data engineering, including API integration, data processing, and pipeline orchestration.

## Project Scope and Limitations
Originally, the project was intended to include an email notification step using Airflow's EmailOperator to notify the team when new data was pulled from the API and ready for EDA and visualization. However, this feature was scrapped due to version conflicts with Apache Airflow in the current development environment.
